      "##### **Air Force Core Strategic Capabilities** In support of Air Force core functions, the AFWCF activities provide maintenance services, weapon system parts, base and medical supplies, and transportation services. The working capital funds are integral to the readiness and sustainability of our air, space, and cyber assets and our ability to deploy forces worldwide and across any theater to support overseas operations and National Defense Strategy interests. Maintenance depots provide equipment, skills, and repair services that keep forces operating worldwide. Supply Management activities procure and manage inventories of consumable and repairable spare parts that support all the force structure mission-ready. USTRANSCOM is the single DoD manager for the Defense Transportation System (DTS) in peace and war. Working capital fund activities, directly and indirectly, provide warfighters the critical services needed to meet global mission capability requirements. **Consolidated Sustainment Activity Group ** The Consolidated Sustainment Activity Group (CSAG) mission is supply management of reparable and consumable items and maintenance services. CSAG is managed under a Chief Executive Officer structure. The Air Force Material Command (AFMC) Commander (AFMC/CC) is the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). The AFMC Director of Logistics (HQ AFMC/A4) serves as the Chief Operating Officer (COO), and the AFMC Director of Financial Management (HQ AFMC/FM) is the Chief Financial Officer (CFO). The Air Force Sustainment Center (AFSC), one of the six centers within AFMC, directs both CSAG divisions' day-to-day operations. The activity operates with two divisions: Maintenance and Supply. Maintenance Division The CSAG-M repairs weapon systems and spare parts to ensure readiness in peacetime and to provide sustainment for overseas operations. The division enhances readiness by efficiently and economically repairing, overhauling, and modifying aircraft, engines, missiles, components and software to meet customer demands. The CSAG-M depots have unique skills and equipment required to support and overhaul both new, complex components and aging weapon systems. During contingencies, the depots can surge repair operations and realign capacity to support the war fighter’s immediate needs. \n",
